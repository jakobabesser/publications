  abstract =       {The number of publications on acoustic scene classification (ASC) in environmental audio recordings has constantly increased over the last few years. This was mainly stimulated by the annual Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) competition with its first edition in 2013. All competitions so far involved one or multiple ASC tasks. With a focus on deep learning based ASC algorithms, this article summarizes and groups existing approaches for data preparation, i.e., feature representations, feature pre-processing, and data augmentation, and for data modeling, i.e., neural network architectures and learning paradigms. Finally, the paper discusses current algorithmic limitations and open challenges in order to preview possible future developments towards the real-life application of ASC systems.},

Furthermore, we investigate the influence of potential transcription errors on the classification accuracy, which tend to occur when real audio data is analyzed. We achieve best classification accuracy values of 60.8% for the feature-based classification and 68.5% for the classification based on pattern similarity based on a taxonomy consisting of 8 different bass playing styles.},

The set consists of 148 single- and multidimensional features related to the melodic, harmonic, rhythmic and structural properties of four instrumental domains. A simple yet common instrumentation model has been applied to describe both the soloing and the accompanying instruments as well as rhythmic and melodic interaction between them. To evaluate the features’ discriminative power related to different musical styles, an evaluation for content-based genre and artist classification has been performed each with two different test sets consisting of symbolic and real audio data. Two different classifier approaches have been utilized, one commonly used support vector machine (SVM) classifier with preliminary discriminant analysis (LDA) and one novel approach based on the Rhythmical Structure Profile which allows a tempo-adaptive representation of the rhythmic context provided by the accompanying instruments. For both classification scenarios, ensemble decisions based on single instrument- related classifiers led to the highest scores of 84.0% for genre and 58.8% for artist classification.},

An existing database of isolated note recordings is extended by approx. 900 samples to evaluate the presented algorithm. We achieve comparable classification accuracy values of 85.1% and 81.5% for classification on class-level and subclass-level. Furthermore, two potential application scenarios are outlined.},

  abstract =       {In this paper, we adapt a recently proposed U-net deep neural network architecture from melody to bass transcription. We investigate pitch shifting and random equalization as data augmentation techniques. In a parameter importance study, we study the influence of the skip connection strategy between the encoder and decoder layers, the data augmentation strategy, as well as of the overall model capacity on the system’s performance. Using a training set that covers various music genres and a validation set that includes jazz ensemble recordings, we obtain the best transcription performance for a downscaled version of the reference algorithm combined with skip connections that transfer intermediate activations between the encoder and decoder. The U-net based method outperforms previous knowledge-driven and data-driven bass transcription algorithms by around five percentage points in overall accuracy. In addition to a pitch estimation improvement, the voicing estimation performance is clearly enhanced.},

  abstract = {Web services allow permanent access to music from all over the world. Especially in the case of web services with user-supplied content, e.g., YouTube(TM), the available metadata is often incomplete or erroneous. On the other hand, a vast amount of high-quality and musically relevant metadata has been annotated in research areas such as Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Although they have great potential, these musical annotations are ofter inaccessible to users outside the academic world. With our contribution, we want to bridge this gap by enriching publicly available multimedia content with musical annotations available in research corpora, while maintaining easy access to the underlying data. Our web-based tools offer researchers and music lovers novel possibilities to interact with and navigate through the content. In this paper, we consider a research corpus called the Weimar Jazz Database (WJD) as an illustrating example scenario. The WJD contains various annotations related to famous jazz solos. First, we establish a link between the WJD annotations and corresponding YouTube videos employing existing retrieval techniques. With these techniques, we were able to identify 988 corresponding YouTube videos for 329 solos out of 456 solos contained in the WJD. We then embed the retrieved videos in a recently developed web-based platform and enrich the videos with solo transcriptions that are part of the WJD. Furthermore, we integrate publicly available data resources from the Semantic Web in order to extend the presented information, for example, with a detailed discography or artists-related information. Our contribution illustrates the potential of modern web-based technologies for the digital humanities, and novel ways for improving access and interaction with digitized multimedia content.},

  Abstract                 = {In this publication we describe a novel two-dimensional approach for automatic music genre classification. Although the subject poses a well studied task in Music Information Retrieval, some fundamental issues of genre classification have not been covered so far. Especially many modern genres are influenced by manifold musical styles. Most of all, this holds true for the broad category “World Music”, which comprises many different regional styles and a mutual mix up thereof. A common approach to tackle this issue in manual categorization is to assign multiple genre labels to a single recording. However, for commonly used automatic classification algorithms, multi- labeling poses a problem due to its ambiguities. Thus, we propose to break down multi-label genre annotations into single-label annotations within given time segments and musical domains. A corresponding multi-stage evaluation based on a representative set of items from a global music taxonomy is performed and discussed accordingly. Therefore, we conduct 3 different experiments that cover multi-labeling, multi-labeling with time segmentation and the proposed multi-domain labeling.}

  abstract =       {In this work, we propose considering the information from a polyphony for multi-pitch estimation (MPE) in piano music recordings. To that aim, we propose a method for local polyphony estimation (LPE), which is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained in a supervised fashion to explicitly predict the degree of polyphony. We investigate two feature representations as inputs to our method, in particular, the Constant-Q Transform (CQT) and its recent extension Folded-CQT (F-CQT). To evaluate the performance of our method, we conduct a series of experiments on real and synthetic piano recordings based on the MIDI Aligned Piano Sounds (MAPS) and the Saarland Music Data (SMD) datasets. We compare our approaches with a state-of-the art piano transcription method by informing said method with the LPE knowledge in a postprocessing stage. The experimental results suggest that using explicit LPE information can refine MPE predictions. Furthermore, it is shown that, on average, the CQT representation is preferred over F-CQT for LPE.},
