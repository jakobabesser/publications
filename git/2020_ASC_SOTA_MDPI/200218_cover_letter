Dear editors,

I am pleased to submit a review article entitled "A Review of Approaches and Challenges for Acoustic Scene Classification"
for consideration for publications in the Special Issue "Deep Learning for Applications in Acoustics: Modeling, Synthesis,
and Listening". In the manuscript I try to systematically summarize existing work on acoustic scene classification based
on deep learning methods and give an outlook on currently open challenges in the field.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Jakob Abe√üer
