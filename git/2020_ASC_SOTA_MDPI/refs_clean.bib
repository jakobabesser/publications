abstract = {In this paper, we present an end-to-end approach for environmental sound classification based on a 1D Convolution Neural Network (CNN) that learns a representation directly from the audio signal. Several convolutional layers are used to capture the signal's fine time structure and learn diverse filters that are relevant to the classification task. The proposed approach can deal with audio signals of any length as it splits the signal into overlapped frames using a sliding window. Different architectures considering several input sizes are evaluated, including the initialization of the first convolutional layer with a Gammatone filterbank that models the human auditory filter response in the cochlea. The performance of the proposed end-to-end approach in classifying environmental sounds was assessed on the UrbanSound8k dataset and the experimental results have shown that it achieves 89{\%} of mean accuracy. Therefore, the propose approach outperforms most of the state-of-the-art approaches that use handcrafted features or 2D representations as input. Furthermore, the proposed approach has a small number of parameters compared to other architectures found in the literature, which reduces the amount of data required for training.},

We achieve this by using a stacked convolutional and recurrent neural network with two prediction layers in sequence one for the strong followed by the weak label. The network is trained using frame-wise log mel-band energy as the input audio feature, and weak labels provided in the dataset as labels for the weak label prediction layer. Strong labels are generated by replicating the weak labels as many number of times as the frames in the input audio feature, and used for strong label layer during training. We propose to control what the network learns from the weak and strong labels by different weighting for the loss computed in the two prediction layers. The proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available dataset of 155 hours with 17 sound event classes. The method achieves the best error rate of 0.84 for strong labels and F-score of 43.3{\%} for weak labels on the unseen test split.},

@inproceedings{Almeida:1984:VarFreqSynHarmonicCoding:ICASSP,
abstract = {The Harmonic Coding concept has already shown its potential for efficiently coding speech. Previous implementations have usec a frame rate of one every 16 ms. This was mainly due to the fact that, with longer frames, even a nonstationary spectral model (of low order) cannot reproduce the zones of fast-varying pitch with the desirable quality. However, the high framing rate is a limitation, since it implies that fewer bits will be available for encoding each frame. A solution for this problem has been devised: the signal is synthesized in the time domain, as a superimposition of "harmonics" whose instantaneous frequency varies continuously along an interpolation curve, within each frame. In this way, fast pitch variations can be tracked with no difficulty. Experimental results are presented, confirming these facts. The integration of this synthesis scheme in a speech coder is discussed.},

abstract = {Unsupervised representation learning shows high promise for generating robust features for acoustic scene analysis. In this regard, we propose and investigate a novel combination of features learnt using both a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and a recurrent sequence to sequence autoencoder (S2SAE). Each of the representation learning algorithms is trained individually on spectral features extracted from audio instances. The learnt representations are: (i) the activations of the discriminator in case of the DCGAN, and (ii) the activations of a fully connected layer between the decoder and encoder units in case of the S2SAE. We then train two multilayer perceptron neural networks on the DCGAN and S2SAE feature vectors to predict the class labels. The individual predicted labels are combined in a weighted decision-level fusion to achieve the final prediction. The system is evaluated on the development partition of the acoustic scene classification data set of the IEEE AASP Challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE 2017). In comparison to the baseline, the accuracy is increased from 74.8 {\%} to 86.4 {\%} using only the DCGAN, to 88.5 {\%} on the development set using only the S2SAE, and to 91.1 {\%} after fusion of the individual predictions.},

Training visual and audio networks from scratch, without any additional supervision other than the raw unconstrained videos themselves, is shown to successfully solve this task, and, more interestingly, result in good visual and audio representations. These features set the new state-of-the-art on two sound classification benchmarks, and perform on par with the state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches on ImageNet classification.

abstract = {The excitation for LPC speech synthesis usually consists of two separate signals - a delta-function pulse once every pitch penod for voiced speech and white noise for unvoiced speech. This manner of representing excitation requires that speech segments be classified accurately into voiced and unvoiced categories and the pitch period of voiced segments be known. It is now well recognised that such a rigid idealization of the vocal excitation is often responsible for the unnatural qualizy a.ssock{\#}ed with synthesized speech. This paper describes a new approach to the excitation problem that does not require a priori knowledge of either the voiced-unvoiced decision or the pitch period. All classes of sounds are generated by exciting the LPC filter with a sequence of pulses; the amplitudes and locations of the pulses are determined using a non-iterative analysis-by-synthesis procedure. This procedure minimizes a perceptual-distance metric representing subjectively-important differences between the waveforms of the original and the synthetic speech signals. The disiance metric takes account of the finite-frequency resolution as well as the ditTerential sensitivity of the human ear to errors in the formant and inter-formant regions of the speech spectrum.},

We leverage the natural synchronization between vision and sound to learn an acoustic representation using two-million unlabeled videos. Unlabeled video has the advantage that it can be economically acquired at massive scales, yet contains useful signals about natural sound. We propose a student-teacher training procedure which transfers discriminative visual knowledge from well established visual recognition models into the sound modality using unlabeled video as a bridge. Our sound representation yields significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks for acoustic scene/object classification.

The multi-task learning is achieved by globally aggregating the skip connections of a beat tracking system built around temporal convolu-tional networks, and feeding them into a tempo classification layer. The benefit of this approach is investigated by the inclusion of training data for which tempo-only annotations are available, and which is shown to provide improvements in beat tracking accuracy.},

abstract = {Understanding and interpreting classification decisions of automated image classification systems is of high value in many applications, as it allows to verify the reasoning of the system and provides additional information to the human expert. Although machine learning methods are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks, they have in most cases the disadvantage of acting as a black box, not providing any information about what made them arrive at a particular decision. This work proposes a general solution to the problem of understanding classification decisions by pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers. We introduce a methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks. These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only verify the validity of the classification decision, but also focus further analysis on regions of potential interest.We evaluate our method for classifiers trained on PASCAL VOC 2009 images, synthetic image data containing geometric shapes, the MNIST handwritten digits data set and for the pre-trained ImageNet model available as part of the Caffe open source package.},

Given a new sequence modeling task or dataset, which architecture should one use? We conduct a systematic evaluation of generic convolutional and recurrent architectures for sequence modeling. The models are evaluated across a broad range of standard tasks that are commonly used to benchmark recurrent networks. Our results indicate that a simple convolutional architecture outperforms canonical recurrent networks such as LSTMs across a diverse range of tasks and datasets, while demonstrating longer effective memory. We conclude that the common association between sequence modeling and recurrent networks should be reconsidered, and convolutional networks should be regarded as a natural starting point for sequence modeling tasks.

In recent years, retrieval systems based on embedding space learning with deep neural networks got a step closer to fulfilling this vision. However, global and local tempo deviations in the music recordings still require careful tuning of the amount of temporal context given to the system. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing an additional soft-attention mechanism on the audio input. Quantitative and qualitative results on synthesized piano data indicate that this attention increases the robustness of the retrieval system by focusing on different parts of the input representation based on the tempo of the audio. Encouraged by these results, we argue for the potential of attention models as a very general tool for many MIR tasks.},

In this way, the strongest connections may be determined early, and subsequent predictions of each trajectory evolution are based on a more reliable partial evolution history, compared to a traditional progressive scheme. As a consequence, the proposed non-progressive tracking algorithm offers a statistically significant improvement of obtained trajectories in terms of better classic pattern recognition measures.},

abstract = {We present the Sounds of New York City (SONYC) project, a smart cities initiative focused on developing a cyber-physical system for the monitoring, analysis and mitigation of urban noise pollution. Noise pollution is one of the topmost quality of life issues for urban residents in the U.S. with proven effects on health, education, the economy, and the environment. Yet, most cities lack the resources to continuously monitor noise and understand the contribution of individual sources, the tools to analyze patterns of noise pollution at city-scale, and the means to empower city agencies to take effective, data-driven action for noise mitigation. The SONYC project advances novel technological and socio-technical solutions that help address these needs. SONYC includes a distributed network of both sensors and people for large-scale noise monitoring. The sensors use low-cost, low-power technology, and cutting-edge machine listening techniques, to produce calibrated acoustic measurements and recognize individual sound sources in real time. Citizen science methods are used to help urban residents connect to city agencies and each other, understand their noise footprint, and facilitate reporting and self-regulation. Crucially, SONYC utilizes big data solutions to analyze, retrieve and visualize information from sensors and citizens, creating a comprehensive acoustic model of the city that can be used to identify significant patterns of noise pollution. These data can be used to drive the strategic application of noise code enforcement by city agencies to optimize the reduction of noise pollution. The entire system, integrating cyber, physical and social infrastructure, forms a closed loop of continuous sensing, analysis and actuation on the environment. SONYC provides a blueprint for the mitigation of noise pollution that can potentially be applied to other cities in the US and abroad.},

SIPLCA can be used for extracting time-frequency patches from spectrograms in an unsupervised manner. Component-wise hidden Markov models are incorporated to the SIPLCA formulation for enforcing temporal constraints on the activation of each acoustic component. The time-frequency patches are converted to cepstral coefficients in order to provide a compact representation of acoustic events within a scene. Experiments are made using a corpus of train station recordings, classified into 6 scene classes. Results show that the proposed model is able to model salient events within a scene and outperforms the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm for the same task.

In order to capture the occurrences of these events we propose to use the Subband Power Distribution (SPD) as a feature. We extract it by computing the histogram of amplitude values in each frequency band of a spectrogram image. The SPD allows us to model the density of events in each frequency band. Our method is evaluated on a large acoustic scene dataset using support vector machines. We outperform the previous methods when using the SPD in conjunction with the histogram of gradients. To reach further improvement, we also consider the use of an approximation of the earth mover's distance kernel to compare histograms in a more suitable way. Using the so-called Sinkhorn kernel improves the results on most of the feature configurations. Best performances reach a 92.8{\%} F1 score.},

An experimental evaluation is performed on two of the largest ASC datasets available in order to compare and discuss the usefulness of these methods for the task.

Most mobile devices contain both cameras and microphones, and companies that develop mobile devices would like to provide functionality for classifying both videos/images and sounds. In order to reduce the development costs one would like to use the same technology for both of these classification tasks. One way of achieving this is to represent environmental sounds as images, and use an image classification neural network when classifying images as well as sounds. In this paper we consider the classification accuracy for different image representations (Spectrogram, MFCC, and CRP) of environmental sounds. We evaluate the accuracy for environmental sounds in three publicly available datasets, using two well-known convolutional deep neural networks for image recognition (AlexNet and GoogLeNet). Our experiments show that we obtain good classification accuracy for the three datasets.},

Yet, this step is often overlooked in scientific publications. In this paper, we focus on the post-processing algorithms used to identify the audio event boundaries. Different post-processing steps are investigated, through smoothing, thresholding, and optimization. In particular, we evaluate different approaches for temporal segmentation, namely statistic-based and parametric methods. Experiments are carried out on the DCASE 2018 challenge task 4 data. We compared post-processing algorithms on the temporal prediction curves of two models: one based on the challenge's baseline and a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model. Results show the crucial impact of the post-processing methods on the final detection score. Statistic-based methods yield a 22.9{\%} event-based F-score on the evaluation set with our MIL model. Moreover, the best results were obtained using class-dependent parametric methods with 32.0{\%} F-score.},

In this paper, we proposed an approach to learning audio scene patterns from scalogram, which is extracted from raw signal with simple wavelet transforms. The experiments were conducted on DCASE2016 dataset. We compared scalogram with classical Mel energy, which showed that multi-scale feature led to an obvious accuracy increase. The convolutional neural network integrated with maximum-average downsampled scalogram achieved an accuracy of 90.5{\%} in the evaluation step in DCASE2016.},

abstract = {An algorithm is presented for the estimation of the fundamental frequency (F0) of speech or musical sounds. It is based on the well-known autocorrelation method with a number of modifications that combine to prevent errors. The algorithm has several desirable features. Error rates are about three times lower than the best competing methods, as evaluated over a database of speech recorded together with a laryngograph signal. There is no upper limit on the frequency search range, so the algorithm is suited for high-pitched voices and music. The algorithm is relatively simple and may be implemented efficiently and with low latency, and it involves few parameters that must be tuned. It is based on a signal model (periodic signal) that may be extended in several ways to handle various forms of aperiodicity that occur in particular applications. Finally, interesting parallels may be drawn with models of auditory processing.},

abstract = {In this paper, a supervised approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for polyphonic piano transcription is presented. The system consists of pitch detection model, onset/offset detection model, and note search model. The pitch detection model is a single-channel CNN predicting the probabilities of pitches contained in one frame of the audio. The onset/offset model based on dual-channel CNN is used for estimating the probabilities of each pitch's onset or offset in a frame. The note search model is rule-based; it integrates the outputs of the pitch model and onset/offset model to determine the final onset, offset and pitch of notes in audio. Two experiments with different dataset conditions are accomplished to compare with state-of-the-art approaches on the same datasets. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach preforms better in both frame-and note-based metrics.},

The FMA aims to overcome this hurdle by providing 917 GiB and 343 days of Creative Commons-licensed audio from 106,574 tracks from 16,341 artists and 14,854 albums, arranged in a hierarchical taxonomy of 161 genres. It provides full-length and high-quality audio, pre-computed features, together with track- and user-level metadata, tags, and free-form text such as biographies. We here describe the dataset and how it was created, propose a train/validation/test split and three subsets, discuss some suitable MIR tasks, and evaluate some baselines for genre recognition.

In this study we focus on chord and key sequence recognition from an audio signal, in the context of pop and rock music. The system exploits a set of novel probabilistic models that describe the relationship between different aspects of music and their temporal evolution. These models are based on a set of parameters with a musical meaning. The models include two diatonic key modes, Dorian and Mixolydian, besides major and minor modes previously considered in the literature. These four key modes are the most used in western pop and rock music. In order to provide a compact representation of the chord and key sequences, three novel time-varying harmony- based features are here introduced. Given the importance of emotion characterization in music, the three features are here related to the mood perceived in songs. The method outperforms the state-of-the-art in both chord and key recognition tasks. In order to better train our parameters, we create annotations of chords and keys for a new dataset of 62 songs from the first five Robbie Williams' albums.},

One major bottleneck for developing automatic depression detection methods lies on the limited data availability. Recently, pretrained text-embeddings have seen success in sparse data scenarios, while pretrained audio embeddings are rarely investigated. This paper proposes DEPA, a self-supervised, Word2Vec like pretrained depression audio embedding method for depression detection. An encoder-decoder network is used to extract DEPA on sparse-data in-domain (DAIC) and large-data out-domain (switchboard, Alzheimer's) datasets. With DEPA as the audio embedding, performance significantly outperforms traditional audio features regarding both classification and regression metrics. Moreover, we show that large-data out-domain pretraining is beneficial to depression detection performance.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art sound event detection (SED) methods usually employ a series of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract useful features from the input audio signal, and then recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model longer temporal context in the extracted features. The number of the channels of the CNNs and size of the weight matrices of the RNNs have a direct effect on the total amount of parameters of the SED method, which is to a couple of millions. Additionally, the usually long sequences that are used as an input to an SED method along with the employment of an RNN, introduce implications like increased training time, difficulty at gradient flow, and impeding the parallelization of the SED method. To tackle all these problems, we propose the replacement of the CNNs with depthwise separable convolutions and the replacement of the RNNs with dilated convolutions. We compare the proposed method to a baseline convolutional neural network on a SED task, and achieve a reduction of the amount of parameters by 85{\%} and average training time per epoch by 78{\%}, and an increase the average frame-wise F1 score and reduction of the average error rate by 4.6{\%} and 3.8{\%}, respectively.},

Indeed, invari- ance to melody transposition, chroma data augmentation and length- specific rhythmic patterns prove to be useful to learn downbeat like- lihood. After the data is segmented in tatums, complementary fea- tures related to melody, rhythm and harmony are extracted and the likelihood of a tatum being at a downbeat position is computed with the aforementioned neural networks. The downbeat sequence is then extracted with a flexible temporal hidden Markov model. We then show the efficiency and robustness of our approach with a compara- tive evaluation conducted on 9 datasets.},

The audio signal is first segmented in frames which are synchronized at the tatum level of the music. We then extract different kind of features based on harmony, melody, rhythm and bass content to feed convolutional neural networks that are adapted to take advantage of each feature characteristics. This ensemble of neural networks is combined to obtain one downbeat likelihood per tatum. The downbeat sequence is finally decoded with a flexible and efficient temporal model which takes advantage of the metrical continuity of a song. We then perform an evaluation of our system on a large base of 9 datasets, compare its performance to 4 other published algorithms and obtain a significant increase of 16.8 percent points compared to the second best system, for altogether a moderate cost in test and training. The influence of each step of the method is studied to show its strengths and shortcomings.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel method for estimating beat from digital audio. We compute autocorrelation such that the distribution of energy in phase space is preserved in a so-called autocorrelation phase matrix (APM). We estimate beats by computing individual APMs over short overlapping segments of an onset trace derived from the audio. Then an adaptation of Viterbi decoding is used to search the APMs for metrical combinations of points that change smoothly over time in the lag/phase plane. Because small temporal perturbations are seen as local movements on the APM, the Viterbi search can be bounded using a small 2D Gaussian window. The resulting algorithm jointly estimates tempo, meter and beat. As is always the case with Viterbi decoding, an online version is possible although best performance is achieved offline. We report results on an annotated dataset of 60-second musical segments},

abstract = {Journal Helia started its "mission" nearly 36 years ago, very unpreten- tiously, as an information bulletin FAO Research Network on Sunflower, with the founders' intention to allow a quick and easy exchange of knowledge gained from experimental field trials of improving and breeding important oilseed crop species, such as sunflower. With the time passing, the number of scien- tists gathered around the project development and promotion of sunflower growing under the FAO Research Network on Sunflower has risen slowly but steadily, while the projects have become more extensive, complex and serious. The abundance of scientific research results, realized in the framework of a research network, determined the direction of the evolution journal Helia in scientific journal with internationally recognized quality, peer-reviewed papers and its relatively high ranking in the scientific society. Since the beginning of publishing in Serbia (1990th), the Journal pub- lished by the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops, as the publisher and edito- rial office headquarters, was under the auspices of F.A.O. and ISA until the 2006th when the editorial office was transferred to the Serbian Academy of Sci- ences and Arts; Branch in Novi Sad, which also assumed the role of the main publisher, while the Institute remained co-publisher.Since 1990 a total of 24 volumes with 47 regular and two extraordinary numbers have been published in the scientific journal HELIA. That is a pretty impressive library with 6900 pages of printed material in 746 scientific papers in English. So far 2125 authors and co-authors of scientific papers from 43 countries from all continents have participated in publishing scientific papers in the journal All submitted manuscripts are subjected to anonymous international review (so-called "single-blind peer review", where the authors of the papers do not know who the reviewers are, but the reviewers know who the authors of the papers are) and published in the journal only after receiving a positive review by two independent reviewers and the final opinion of the editor. Regarding the impact factor of the ISJ Helia in the last 10 years, accord- ing to citation indicators of some papers published in the journal, it can be concluded that it has had relatively high levels over the past 10 years, with a trend of significant increase in 2011 and 2012. Focusing on that parameter, and relatively high two-and five-year impact factors in 2011 and 2012, we can be very satisfied about these trends, which have led to our journal being ranked near relatively influential journals on the global level.},

@inproceedings{Fitz:1992:MQLimitedOscillators:ICMC,
abstract = {The McAulay-Quatieri (MQ) analysis is a robust, general sinusoidal analysis technique. Unlike many other analysis techniques, it can be used to analyze sounds without a stable harmonic structure (i. e., polyphonic or non-harmonic sounds and instrument tones with extreme vibrato). The MQ technique can provide the time-varying spectral information needed to control a real-time additive synthesis engine. Unfortunately, the original MQ technique generates an arbitrary number of sinusoidal tracks, while a real-time system has a limited number of oscillators. This paper presents some improvements to the basic MQ analysis technique which, in addition to improving the quality of the ensuing syntheses, and making the sinusoidal model more robust, make the MQ analysis data more suitable for controlling a real-time sinusoidal synthesis engine with a fixed number of oscillators. 1. The Choice of the McAulay-Quatieri Model In our research, we have sought a model for sound that would accommodate synthesis with time scale modifications. The goal has been to find a model that would produce time-scaled syntheses of sampled audio signals that are otherwise perceptually equivalent to the original signals. We chose a sinusoidal model advanced by McAulay and Quatieri (McAulay and Quatieri 1985) as the basis for our research. The MQ sinusoidal model allows independent time-and frequency-scale modification. Many implementations of sinusoidal modeling derive sinusoidal components from the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and are of limited use for time-and frequency-scale modification because of artifacts caused by phase uncertainty and discotinuities. (A more detailed description of the STFT may be found in signal processing texts.) Pitch tracking analysis methods have been used in the past to solve some of these problems, but their use is restricted to the class of monophonic, strongly harmonic signals (Grey 1975, Haken 1989). McAulay and Quatieri (McAulay and Quatieri 1985) propose a sinusoidal analysis technique for speech processing. The premise of the MQ technique is that a sound can be represented by a collection of sinusoidal components (called tracks), each with time-varying amplitude and frequency. To construct these tracks, STFT's are performed on a signal at regular intervals, called frames. Amplitude peaks in the resulting frequency spectra are identified, and parabolic interpolation is used to obtain a close approximation of the exact spectral peak frequencies. These peaks are the most prominent frequencies in the sound at that instant. The peaks in adjacent frames are compared and peaks of similar frequencies are matched. A continuous chain of these matched peaks is a track. A peak that is not matched represents the birth or death of a track. MQ synthesis uses cubic phase interpolation to reduce phase uncertainty and eliminate phase discontinuities. 2. Lemur Extensions Lemur is a Macintosh implementation of the MQ technique with some extensions. It is based on the program MQAN, written by Rob Maher and James Beauchamp at the Computer Music Project at the University of Illinois (Maher 1989), which implemented the original MQ analysis/synthesis technique on a UNIX system. Lemur provides some extensions to the basic MQ technique.},

Both parameters are evaluated at the center frequency to. of the passband whose spectral width is W. rad/s. We show that the short-time spectral amplitude is identical to the Hilbert envelope A. of the passband waveform.

No comparable statements can be adduced for A. and q•., but on practical grounds, we conjecture that useful low-pass limits of less than W./2 can be applied to both. Finally, we outline techniques to utilize the passband parameters A., q•., A. • and A. • q•n in digital voice coding},

abstract = {We propose a model to estimate the fundamental frequency in monophonic audio, often referred to as pitch estimation. We acknowledge the fact that obtaining ground truth annotations at the required temporal and frequency resolution is a particularly daunting task. Therefore, we propose to adopt a self-supervised learning technique, which is able to estimate (relative) pitch without any form of supervision. The key observation is that pitch shift maps to a simple translation when the audio signal is analysed through the lens of the constant-Q transform (CQT). We design a self-supervised task by feeding two shifted slices of the CQT to the same convolutional encoder, and require that the difference in the outputs is proportional to the corresponding difference in pitch. In addition, we introduce a small model head on top of the encoder, which is able to determine the confidence of the pitch estimate, so as to distinguish between voiced and unvoiced audio. Our results show that the proposed method is able to estimate pitch at a level of accuracy comparable to fully supervised models, both on clean and noisy audio samples, yet it does not require access to large labeled datasets},

abstract = {Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) have shown promise in image generation and semi-supervised learning (SSL). However, existing GANs in SSL have two problems: (1) the generator and the discriminator (i.e. the classifier) may not be optimal at the same time; and (2) the generator cannot control the semantics of the generated samples. The problems essentially arise from the two-player formulation, where a single discriminator shares incompatible roles of identifying fake samples and predicting labels and it only estimates the data without considering the labels. To address the problems, we present triple generative adversarial net (Triple-GAN), which consists of three players - a generator, a discriminator and a classifier. The generator and the classifier characterize the conditional distributions between images and labels, and the discriminator solely focuses on identifying fake image-label pairs. We design compatible utilities to ensure that the distributions characterized by the classifier and the generator both converge to the data distribution. Our results on various datasets demonstrate that Triple-GAN as a unified model can simultaneously (1) achieve the state-of-the-art classification results among deep generative models, and (2) disentangle the classes and styles of the input and transfer smoothly in the data space via interpolation in the latent space class-conditionally.},

MorphNet iteratively shrinks and expands a network, shrinking via a resource-weighted sparsifying regularizer on activations and expanding via a uniform multiplicative factor on all layers. In contrast to previous approaches, our method is scalable to large networks, adaptable to specific resource constraints (e.g. the number of floating-point operations per inference), and capable of increasing the network's performance. When applied to standard network architectures on a wide variety of datasets, our approach discovers novel structures in each domain, obtaining higher performance while respecting the resource constraint.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the concept of music scene description and address the problem of detecting melody and bass lines in real-world audio signals containing the sounds of various instruments. Most previous pitch-estimation methods have had difficulty dealing with such complex music signals because these methods were designed to deal with mixtures of only a few sounds. To enable estimation of the fundamental frequency (F0) of the melody and bass lines, we propose a predominant-F0 estimation method called PreFEst that does not rely on the unreliable fundamental compo- nent and obtains the most predominant F0 supported by harmonics within an intentionally limited frequency range. This method estimates the relative dominance of every possible F0 (represented as a probability density function of the F0) by using MAP (maximum a posteriori probability) estimation and considers the F0!s temporal continuity by using a multiple-agent architecture. Experimental results with a set of ten music excerpts from compact-disc recordings showed that a real-time system implementing this method was able to detect melody and bass lines about 80{\%} of the time these existed. !},

abstract = {We report on the tempo induction contest organized during the International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR 2004) held at the University Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain, in October 2004. The goal of this contest was to evaluate some state-of-the-art algorithms in the task of inducing the basic tempo (as a scalar, in beats per minute) from musical audio signals. To our knowledge, this is the first published large scale cross-validation of audio tempo induction algorithms. Participants were invited to submit algorithms to the contest organizer, in one of several allowed formats. No training data was provided. A total of 12 entries (representing the work of seven research teams) were evaluated, 11 of which are reported in this document. Results on the test set of 3199 instances were returned to the participants before they were made public. Anssi Klapuri's algorithm won the contest. This evaluation shows that tempo induction algorithms can reach over 80{\%} accuracy for music with a constant tempo, if we do not insist on finding a specific metrical level. After the competition, the algorithms and results were analyzed in order to discover general lessons for the future development of tempo induction systems. One conclusion is that robust tempo induction entails the processing of frame features rather than that of onset lists. Further, we propose a new "redundant" approach to tempo induction, inspired by knowledge of human perceptual mechanisms, which combines multiple simpler methods using a voting mechanism. Machine emulation of human tempo induction is still an open issue. Many avenues for future work in audio tempo tracking are highlighted, as for instance the definition of the best rhythmic features and the most appropriate periodicity detection method. In order to stimulate further research, the contest results, annotations, evaluation software and part of the data are available at http://ismir2004.ismir.net/ISMIR{\_}Contest.html},

The DirAC features are shown to perform well in scene classification, with some subsets of these features outperforming the MFCC classification.

abstract = {The ongoing process of automation in production lines increases the requirements for robust and reliable quality control. Acoustic quality control can play a major part in advanced quality control systems since several types of faults such as changes in machine conditions can be heard by experienced machine operators but can hardly be detected otherwise. To this day, acoustic detection systems using airborne sounds struggle due to the highly complex noise scenarios inside factories. Machine learning systems are theoretically able to cope with these conditions. However, recent advancements in the field of Industrial Sound Analysis (ISA) are sparse compared to related research fields like Music Information Retrieval (MIR) or Acoustic Event Detection (AED). One main reason is the lack of freely available datasets since most of the data is very sensitive for companies. Therefore, three novel datasets for ISA with different application fields were recorded and published along with this paper: detection of the operational state of an electric engine, detection of the surface of rolling metal balls, and detection of different bulk materials. For each dataset, neural network based baseline systems were evaluated. The results show that such systems obtain high classification accuracies over all datasets in many of the subtasks which demonstrates the feasibility of audio-based analysis of industrial analysis scenarios. However, the baseline systems remain highly sensitive to changes in the recording setup, which leaves a lot of room for improvement. The main goal of this paper is to stimulate further research in the field of ISA.},

Datasets for polyphonic instrument recognition can be categorized into roughly two categories. Some, such as MedleyDB, have strong per-frame instrument activity annotations but are usually small in size. Other, larger datasets such as OpenMIC only have weak labels, i.e., instrument presence or absence is annotated only for long snippets of a song. We explore an attention mechanism for handling weakly labeled data for multi-label instrument recognition. Attention has been found to perform well for other tasks with weakly labeled data. We compare the proposed attention model to multiple models which include a baseline binary relevance random forest, recurrent neural network, and fully connected neural networks. Our results show that incorporating attention leads to an overall improvement in classification accuracy metrics across all 20 instruments in the OpenMIC dataset. We find that attention enables models to focus on (or `attend to') specific time segments in the audio relevant to each instrument label leading to interpretable results.},

Semi-supervised training methods make use of abundantly available unlabeled data and a smaller number of labeled examples. We propose a new framework for semi-supervised training of deep neural networks inspired by learning in humans. “Associations” are made from embeddings of labeled samples to those of unlabeled ones and back. The optimization schedule encourages correct association cycles that end up at the same class from which the association was started and penalizes wrong associations ending at a different class. The implementation is easy to use and can be added to any existing end-to-end training setup. We demonstrate the capabilities of learning by association on several data sets and show that it can improve performance on classification tasks tremendously by making use of additionally available unlabeled data. In particular, for cases with few labeled data, our training scheme outperforms the current state of the art on SVHN.},

abstract = {Identifying musical instruments in polyphonic music recordings is a challenging but important problem in the field of music information retrieval. It enables music search by instrument, helps recognize musical genres, or can make music transcription easier and more accurate. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network framework for predominant instrument recognition in real-world polyphonic music. We train our network from fixed-length music excerpts with a single-labeled predominant instrument and estimate an arbitrary number of predominant instruments from an audio signal with a variable length. To obtain the audio-excerpt-wise result, we aggregate multiple outputs from sliding windows over the test audio. In doing so, we investigated two different aggregation methods: one takes the class-wise average followed by normalization, and the other perform temporally local class-wise max-pooling on the output probability prior to averaging and normalization steps to minimize the effect of averaging process suppresses the activation of sporadically appearing instruments. In addition, we conducted extensive experiments on several important factors that affect the performance, including analysis window size, identification threshold, and activation functions for neural networks to find the optimal set of parameters. Our analysis on the instrument-wise performance found that the onset type is a critical factor for recall and precision of each instrument. Using a dataset of 10k audio excerpts from 11 instruments for evaluation, we found that convolutional neural networks are more robust than conventional methods that exploit spectral features and source separation with support vector machines. Experimental results showed that the proposed convolutional network architecture obtained an F1 measure of 0.619 for micro and 0.513 for macro, respectively, achieving 23.1{\%} and 18.8{\%} in performance improvement compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm.},

Our model predicts pitch onset events and then uses those predictions to condition framewise pitch predictions. During inference, we restrict the predictions from the framewise detector by not allowing a new note to start unless the onset detector also agrees that an onset for that pitch is present in the frame. We focus on improving onsets and offsets together instead of either in isolation as we believe this correlates better with human musical perception. Our approach results in over a 100{\%} relative improvement in note F1 score (with offsets) on the MAPS dataset. Furthermore, we extend the model to predict relative velocities of normalized audio which results in more natural-sounding transcriptions.},

Using our approach we demonstrate how to compile a new evaluation dataset comprised of difﬁcult excerpts for beat tracking and examine this difﬁculty in the context of perceptual and musical properties.

abstract = {Identification of instruments in polyphonic recordings is a challenging, but fundamental problem in music informa-tion retrieval. While there has been significant progress in developing predictive models for this and related classifi-cation tasks, we as a community lack a common data-set which is large, freely available, diverse, and representative of naturally occurring recordings. This limits our ability to measure the efficacy of computational models. This article describes the construction of a new, open data-set for multi-instrument recognition. The dataset con-tains 20,000 examples of Creative Commons-licensed mu-sic available on the Free Music Archive. Each example is a 10-second excerpt which has been partially labeled for the presence or absence of 20 instrument classes by annotators on a crowd-sourcing platform. We describe in detail how the instrument taxonomy was constructed, how the data-set was sampled and annotated, and compare its character-istics to similar, previous data-sets. Finally, we present ex-perimental results and baseline model performance to mo-tivate future work.},

This task is important for not only automatic transcription but also many retrieval problems. In this paper, we use the newly released MusicNet dataset to study this front, by building and evaluating a convolutional neural network for making frame-level instrument prediction. We consider it as a multi-label classification problem for each frame and use frame-level annotations as the supervisory signal in training the network. Moreover, we experiment with different ways to incorporate pitch information to our model, with the premise that doing so informs the model the notes that are active per frame, and also encourages the model to learn relative rates of energy buildup in the harmonic partials of different instruments. Experiments show salient performance improvement over baseline methods. We also report an analysis probing how pitch information helps the instrument prediction task.

abstract = {The types of sound events that occur in a situation are limited, and some sound events are likely to co-occur; for instance, ``dishes'' and ``glass jingling.'' In this paper, we introduce a technique of sound event detection utilizing graph Laplacian regularization taking the sound event co-occurrence into account. To consider the co-occurrence of sound events in a sound event detection system, we first represent sound event occurrences as a graph whose nodes indicate the frequency of event occurrence and whose edges indicate the co-occurrence of sound events. We then utilize this graph structure for sound event modeling, which is optimized under an objective function with a regularization term considering the graph structure. Experimental results obtained using TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016 development and 2017 development datasets indicate that the proposed method improves the detection performance of sound events by 7.9 percentage points compared to that of the conventional CNN-BiGRU-based method in terms of the segment-based F1-score. Moreover, the results show that the proposed method can detect co-occurring sound events more accurately than the conventional method.},

To aid in the survey of beat processing abilities in the general population, as well as to attempt to identify and differentiate impairments in beat processing, we have developed a psychophysical test called the Beat Alignment Test (BAT). The BAT is intended to complement existing tests of rhythm processing by directly examining beat perception in isolation from beat synchronization. The goals of the BAT are 1) to study the distribution of beat-based processing abilities in the normal population and 2) to provide a way to search for “rhythm deaf” individuals, who have trouble with beat processing in music though they are not tone deaf. The BAT is easily implemented and it is our hope that it is widely adopted. Data from a pilot study of 30 individuals is presented.},

In this paper, we address the task of characterizing acoustic scenes in a workplace setting from audio recordings collected with wearable microphones. The acoustic scenes, tracked with Bluetooth transceivers, vary dynamically with time from the egocentric perspective of a mobile user. Our dataset contains experience sampled long audio recordings collected from clinical providers in a hospital, who wore the audio badges during multiple work shifts. To handle the long egocentric recordings, we propose a Time Delay Neural Network{\~{}}(TDNN)-based segment-level modeling. The experiments show that TDNN outperforms other models in the acoustic scene classification task. We investigate the effect of primary speaker's speech in determining acoustic scenes from audio badges, and provide a comparison between performance of different models. Moreover, we explore the relationship between the sequence of acoustic scenes experienced by the users and the nature of their jobs, and find that the scene sequence predicted by our model tend to possess similar relationship. The initial promising results reveal numerous research directions for acoustic scene classification via wearable devices as well as egocentric analysis of dynamic acoustic scenes encountered by the users.},

abstract = {While audio chord recognition systems have acquired considerable accuracy on small vocabularies (e.g., ma-jor/minor chords), the large-vocabulary chord recognition problem still remains unsolved. This problem hinders the practical usages of audio recognition systems. The difficulty mainly lies in the intrinsic long-tail distribution of chord qualities, and most chord qualities have too few samples for model training. In this paper, we propose a new model for audio chord recognition under a huge chord vocabulary. The core concept is to decompose any chord label into a set of musically meaningful components (e.g., triad, bass, seventh), each with a much smaller vocabulary compared to the size of the overall chord vocabulary. A multitask classifier is then trained to recognize all the components given the audio feature, and then labels of individual components are reassembled to form the final chord label. Experiments show that the proposed system not only achieves state-of-the-art results on traditional evaluation metrics but also performs well on a large vocabulary. Large-vocabulary chord transcription is a difficult task, as the number of chord qualities is large, and the distribution of training chord classes is extremely biased. For example, the Billboard dataset [2], a human-annotated dataset, contains 230 different chord qualities, or equivalently, 2,749 distinct chord classes 1. While the first 10{\%} chord qualities cover 93.86{\%} of the data, the last 50{\%} chord qualities only cover 0.35{\%} of the data altogether 2. Such a long-tailed chord distribution makes it extremely hard to model rare chord qualities. To bypass the problem, former systems typically adopt two kinds of strategies: chord quality simplification and 1 We here assume that each chord quality can be combined with all possible 12 roots except for the N chord. 2 In calculation, the chord quality counts are weighted by their durations .},

abstract = {We present a novel neural network for processing sequences. The ByteNet is a one-dimensional convolutional neural network that is composed of two parts, one to encode the source sequence and the other to decode the target sequence. The two network parts are connected by stacking the decoder on top of the encoder and preserving the temporal resolution of the sequences. To address the differing lengths of the source and the target, we introduce an efficient mechanism by which the decoder is dynamically unfolded over the representation of the encoder. The ByteNet uses dilation in the convolutional layers to increase its receptive field. The resulting network has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and it sidesteps the need for excessive memorization. The ByteNet decoder attains state-of-the-art performance on character-level language modelling and outperforms the previous best results obtained with recurrent networks. The ByteNet also achieves state-of-the-art performance on character-to-character machine translation on the English-to-German WMT translation task, surpassing comparable neural translation models that are based on recurrent networks with attentional pooling and run in quadratic time. We find that the latent alignment structure contained in the representations reflects the expected alignment between the tokens.},

abstract = {We describe a novel weakly labeled Audio Event Classification approach based on a self-supervised attention model. The weakly labeled framework is used to eliminate the need for expensive data labeling procedure and self-supervised attention is deployed to help a model distinguish between relevant and irrelevant parts of a weakly labeled audio clip in a more effective manner compared to prior attention models. We also propose a highly effective strongly supervised attention model when strong labels are available. This model also serves as an upper bound for the self-supervised model. The performances of the model with self-supervised attention training are comparable to the strongly supervised one which is trained using strong labels. We show that our self-supervised attention method is especially beneficial for short audio events. We achieve 8.8{\%} and 17.6{\%} relative mean average precision improvements over the current state-of-the-art systems for SL-DCASE-17 and balanced AudioSet.},

@article{Kim:2019:AdversarialLearning:ARXIV,
abstract = {Automatic music transcription is considered to be one of the hardest problems in music information retrieval, yet recent deep learning approaches have achieved substantial improvements on transcription performance. These approaches commonly employ supervised learning models that predict various time-frequency representations, by minimizing element-wise losses such as the cross entropy function. However, applying the loss in this manner assumes conditional independence of each label given the input, and thus cannot accurately express inter-label dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce an adversarial training scheme that operates directly on the time-frequency representations and makes the output distribution closer to the ground-truth. Through adversarial learning, we achieve a consistent improvement in both frame-level and note-level metrics over Onsets and Frames, a state-of-the-art music transcription model. Our results show that adversarial learning can significantly reduce the error rate while increasing the confidence of the model estimations. Our approach is generic and applicable to any transcription model based on multi-label predictions, which are very common in music signal analysis.},

abstract = {The task of estimating the fundamental frequency of a monophonic sound recording, also known as pitch tracking, is fundamental to audio processing with multiple applications in speech processing and music information retrieval. To date, the best performing techniques, such as the pYIN algorithm, are based on a combination of DSP pipelines and heuristics. While such techniques perform very well on average, there remain many cases in which they fail to correctly estimate the pitch. In this paper, we propose a data-driven pitch tracking algorithm, CREPE, which is based on a deep convolutional neural network that operates directly on the time-domain waveform. We show that the proposed model produces state-of-the-art results, performing equally or better than pYIN. Furthermore, we evaluate the model's generalizability in terms of noise robustness. A pre-trained version of CREPE is made freely available as an open-source Python module for easy application.},

abstract = {Audio tagging is the task of predicting the presence or absence of sound classes within an audio clip. Previous work in audio classification focused on relatively small datasets limited to recognising a small number of sound classes. We investigate audio tagging on AudioSet, which is a dataset consisting of over 2 million audio clips and 527 classes. AudioSet is weakly labelled, in that only the presence or absence of sound classes is known for each clip, while the onset and offset times are unknown. To address the weakly-labelled audio classification problem, we propose attention neural networks as a way to attend the the most salient parts of an audio clip. We bridge the connection between attention neural networks and multiple instance learning (MIL) methods, and propose decision-level and feature-level attention neural networks for audio tagging. We investigate attention neural networks modelled by different functions, depths and widths. Experiments on AudioSet show that the feature-level attention neural network achieves a state-of-the-art mean average precision (mAP) of 0.369, outperforming the best multiple instance learning (MIL) method of 0.317 and Google's deep neural network baseline of 0.314. In addition, we discover that the audio tagging performance on AudioSet embedding features has a weak correlation with the number of training examples and the quality of labels of each sound class.},

@article{Koops:2019:harmony_subjectivity:journal,
abstract = {Reference annotation datasets containing harmony annotations are at the core of a wide range of studies in music information retrieval (MIR) and related fields. The majority of these datasets contain single reference annotations describing the harmony of each piece. Nevertheless, studies showing differences among annotators in many other MIR tasks make the notion of a single ‘ground-truth' reference annotation a tenuous one. In this paper, we introduce and analyse the Chordify Annotator Subjectivity Dataset (CASD) containing chord labels for 50 songs from 4 expert annotators in order to gain a better understanding of the differences between annotators in their chord label choice. Our analysis reveals that annotators use distinct chord-label vocabularies, with low chord-label overlap across all annotators. Between annotators, we find only 73 percent overlap on average for the traditional major–minor vocabulary and 54 percent overlap for the most complex chord labels. A factor analysis reveals the relative importance of triads, sevenths, inversions and other musical factors for each annotator on their choice of chord labels and reported difficulty of the songs. Our results further substantiate the existence of a harmonic ‘subjectivity ceiling': an upper bound for evaluations in computational harmony research. Current state-of-the-art chord-estimation systems perform beyond this subjectivity ceiling by about 10 percent. This suggests that current ACE algorithms are powerful enough to tune themselves to particular annotators' idiosyncrasies. Overall, our results show that annotator subjectivity is an important factor in harmonic transcriptions, which should inform future studies into harmony perception and computational models of harmony.},

Without further finetuning, the resulting audio features achieve performance superior or comparable to the state-of-the-art on established audio classification benchmarks (DCASE2014 and ESC-50).

Our model builds upon the basic structure proposed by Whiteley et. al [20], which we further modified by introducing a new observa- tion model: rhythmic patterns are learned directly from data, which makes the model adaptable to the rhythmical structure of any kind of music. For learning rhythmic pat- terns and evaluating beat and downbeat tracking, 697 ball- room dance pieces were annotated with beat and measure information. The results showed that explicitly modeling rhythmic patterns of dance styles drastically reduces oc- tave errors (detection of half or double tempo) and sub- stantially improves downbeat tracking.},

abstract = {Few-shot models have become a popular topic of research in the past years. They offer the possibility to determine class belongings for unseen examples using just a handful of examples for each class. Such models are trained on a wide range of classes and their respective examples, learning a decision metric in the process. Types of few-shot models include matching networks and prototypical networks. We show a new way of training prototypical few-shot models for just a single class. These models have the ability to predict the likelihood of an unseen query belonging to a group of examples without any given counterexamples. The difficulty here lies in the fact that no relative distance to other classes can be calculated via softmax. We solve this problem by introducing a "null class" centered around zero, and enforcing centering with batch normalization. Trained on the commonly used Omniglot data set, we obtain a classification accuracy of .98 on the matched test set, and of .8 on unmatched MNIST data. On the more complex MiniImageNet data set, test accuracy is .8. In addition, we propose a novel Gaussian layer for distance calculation in a prototypical network, which takes the support examples' distribution rather than just their centroid into account. This extension shows promising results when a higher number of support examples is available.},

In this paper, we present a system to learn a joint embedding space of monophonic and mixed tracks for singing voice. We use a metric learning method, which ensures that tracks from both domains of the same singer are mapped closer to each other than those of different singers. We train the system on a large synthetic dataset generated by music mashup to reflect real-world music recordings. Our approach opens up new possibilities for cross-domain tasks, e.g., given a monophonic track of a singer as a query, retrieving mixed tracks sung by the same singer from the database. Also, it requires no additional vocal enhancement steps such as source separation. We show the effectiveness of our system for singer identification and query-by-singer in both the in-domain and cross-domain tasks.},

The aim of the present work is to improve the label efficiency of large neural networks operating on audio data through a combination of multitask learning and self-supervised learning on unlabeled data. We trained an end-to-end audio feature extractor based on WaveNet that feeds into simple, yet versatile task-specific neural networks. We describe several easily implemented self-supervised learning tasks that can operate on any large, unlabeled audio corpus. We demonstrate that, in scenarios with limited labeled training data, one can significantly improve the performance of three different supervised classification tasks individually by up to 6{\%} through simultaneous training with these additional self-supervised tasks. We also show that incorporating data augmentation into our multitask setting leads to even further gains in performance.},

We describe our methodology for the creation of the dataset, particularly highlighting our approaches to address the challenges involved in maintaining synchronization and expressiveness. We demonstrate the high quality of synchronization achieved with our proposed approach by comparing the dataset with existing widely used music audio datasets.

We benchmark two existing MIR tasks (multipitch analysis and score-informed source separation) on the dataset and compare them with other existing music audio datasets. In addition, we consider two novel multimodal MIR tasks (visually informed multipitch analysis and polyphonic vibrato analysis) enabled by the dataset and provide evaluation measurements and baseline systems for future comparisons (from our recent work).

Improving accessibility to these videos for the hearing impaired and for search and indexing purposes is an excellent application of automatic speech recognition. However, YouTube videos are extremely challenging for automatic speech recognition systems. Standard adapted Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based acoustic models can have word error rates above 50{\%}, making this one of the most difficult reported tasks. Since 2009, YouTube has provided automatic generation of closed captions for videos detected to have English speech; the service now supports ten different languages.

Applying an “island of confidence” filtering heuristic to select useful training segments, and increasing the model size by using 44,526 context dependent states with a low-rank final layer weight matrix approximation, improved performance by about 13{\%} relative compared to previously reported sequence trained DNN results for this task.},

This letter investigates the adequacy of PCEN for spectrogram-based pattern recognition in far-field noisy recordings, both from theoretical and practical standpoints. First, we apply PCEN on various datasets of natural acoustic environments and find empirically that it Gaussianizes distributions of magnitudes while decorrelating frequency bands. Second, we describe the asymptotic regimes of each component in PCEN: temporal integration, gain control, and dynamic range compression. Third, we give practical advice for adapting PCEN parameters to the temporal properties of the noise to be mitigated, the signal to be enhanced, and the choice of time-frequency representation. As it converts a large class of real-world soundscapes into additive white Gaussian noise, PCEN is a computationally efficient frontend for robust detection and classification of acoustic events in heterogeneous environments.},

abstract = {Bioacoustic sensors, sometimes known as autonomous recording units (ARUs), can record sounds of wildlife over long periods of time in scalable and minimally invasive ways. Deriving per-species abundance estimates from these sensors requires detection, classification, and quantification of animal vocalizations as individual acoustic events. Yet, variability in ambient noise, both over time and across sensors, hinders the reliability of current automated systems for sound event detection (SED), such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) in the time-frequency domain. In this article, we develop, benchmark, and combine several machine listening techniques to improve the generalizability of SED models across heterogeneous acoustic environments. As a case study, we consider the problem of detecting avian flight calls from a ten-hour recording of nocturnal bird migration, recorded by a network of six ARUs in the presence of heterogeneous background noise. Starting from a CNN yielding state-of-the-art accuracy on this task, we introduce two noise adaptation techniques, respectively integrating short-term (60-millisecond) and long-term (30-minute) context. First, we apply per-channel energy normalization (PCEN) in the time-frequency domain, which applies short-term automatic gain control to every subband in the mel-frequency spectrogram. Secondly, we replace the last dense layer in the network by a context-adaptive neural network (CA-NN) layer, i.e. an affine layer whose weights are dynamically adapted at prediction time by an auxiliary network taking long-term summary statistics of spectrotemporal features as input. We show that both techniques are helpful and complementary. [...] We release a pre-trained version of our best performing system under the name of BirdVoxDetect, a ready-to-use detector of avian flight calls in field recordings.},

@article{Luo:2018:ConvTasNet:ARXIV,
abstract = {Single-channel, speaker-independent speech separation methods have recently seen great progress. However, the accuracy, latency, and computational cost of such methods remain insufficient. The majority of the previous methods have formulated the separation problem through the time-frequency representation of the mixed signal, which has several drawbacks, including the decoupling of the phase and magnitude of the signal, the suboptimality of time-frequency representation for speech separation, and the long latency in calculating the spectrograms. To address these shortcomings, we propose a fully-convolutional time-domain audio separation network (Conv-TasNet), a deep learning framework for end-to-end time-domain speech separation. Conv-TasNet uses a linear encoder to generate a representation of the speech waveform optimized for separating individual speakers. Speaker separation is achieved by applying a set of weighting functions (masks) to the encoder output. The modified encoder representations are then inverted back to the waveforms using a linear decoder. The masks are found using a temporal convolutional network (TCN) consisting of stacked 1-D dilated convolutional blocks, which allows the network to model the long-term dependencies of the speech signal while maintaining a small model size. The proposed Conv-TasNet system significantly outperforms previous time-frequency masking methods in separating two- and three-speaker mixtures. Additionally, Conv-TasNet surpasses several ideal time-frequency magnitude masks in two-speaker speech separation as evaluated by both objective distortion measures and subjective quality assessment by human listeners. Finally, Conv-TasNet has a significantly smaller model size and a shorter minimum latency, making it a suitable solution for both offline and real-time speech separation applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, we learn disentangled representations of timbre and pitch for musical instrument sounds. We adapt a framework based on variational autoencoders with Gaussian mixture latent distributions. Specifically, we use two separate encoders to learn distinct latent spaces for timbre and pitch, which form Gaussian mixture components representing instrument identity and pitch, respectively. For reconstruction, latent variables of timbre and pitch are sampled from corresponding mixture components, and are concatenated as the input to a decoder. We show the model efficacy by latent space visualization, and a quantitative analysis indicates the discriminability of these spaces, even with a limited number of instrument labels for training. The model allows for controllable synthesis of selected instrument sounds by sampling from the latent spaces. To evaluate this, we trained instrument and pitch classifiers using original labeled data. These classifiers achieve high accuracy when tested on our synthesized sounds, which verifies the model performance of controllable realistic timbre and pitch synthesis. Our model also enables timbre transfer between multiple instruments, with a single autoencoder architecture, which is evaluated by measuring the shift in posterior of instrument classification. Our in depth evaluation confirms the model ability to successfully disentangle timbre and pitch.},

abstract = {We present a single deep learning architecture that can both separate an audio recording of a musical mixture into constituent single-instrument recordings and transcribe these instruments into a human-readable format at the same time, learning a shared musical representation for both tasks. This novel architecture, which we call Cerberus, builds on the Chimera network for source separation by adding a third "head" for transcription. By training each head with different losses, we are able to jointly learn how to separate and transcribe up to 5 instruments in our experiments with a single network. We show that the two tasks are highly complementary with one another and when learned jointly, lead to Cerberus networks that are better at both separation and transcription and generalize better to unseen mixtures.},

It is our contri-bution to the Acoustic Scene Classification task of the IEEE AASP Challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE2016). The system classifies 15 different acoustic scenes. First, auditory spectral features are extracted and fed into 15 binary deep multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP). MLP are trained with the 'one-against-all' paradigm to perform a pair-wise decomposition. In a second stage, a large number of spectral, cepstral, energy and voicing-related audio features are extracted. Multiscale Gaussian kernels are then used in constructing optimal linear combination of Gram matrices for multiple kernel subspace learning. The reduced feature set is fed into a nearest-neighbour classifier. Predictions from the two systems are then combined by a threshold-based decision function. On the official development set of the challenge, an accuracy of 81.4{\%} is achieved.},

Conventional YIN is a simple yet effective method for frame-wise monophonic F0 estimation and remains one of the most popular methods in this domain. In order to eliminate short-term errors, outputs of frequency estimators are usually post-processed resulting in a smoother pitch track. One shortcoming of YIN is that such post-processing cannot fall back on alternative interpretations of the signal because the method outputs precisely one estimate per frame. To address this problem we modify YIN to output multiple pitch candidates with associated probabilities (PYIN Stage 1). These probabilities arise naturally from a prior distribution on the YIN threshold parameter. We use these probabilities as observations in a hidden Markov model, which is Viterbi-decoded to produce an improved pitch track (PYIN Stage 2). We demonstrate that the combination of Stages 1 and 2 raises recall and precision substantially. The additional computational complexity of PYIN over YIN is low. We make the method freely available online1 as an open source C++ library for Vamp hosts.},

The model assumes that the release fraction of the transmitter is a function of stimulus intensity. It further assumes that some of this transmitter substance is taken back into the cell while some is irretrievably lost from the cleft. These assumptions differ from other recent models which propose multiple release sites, fixed release fractions, and no transmitter reuptake. The model produces realistic mammalian rate intensity functions, interval and period histograms, incremental responses, and adaptation effects. It mimics successfully the adaptation of successive EPSP amplitudes of the afferent neuron of the goldfish sacculus and offers a reinterpretation of the implications of these studies for hair cell synaptic mechanism.},

The second edition of the challenge on detection and classification of acoustic scenes and events DCASE 2016 has offered such an opportunity for development of the state-of-the-art methods, and succeeded in drawing together a large number of participants from academic and industrial backgrounds. In this paper, we report on the tasks and outcomes of the DCASE 2016 challenge. The challenge comprised four tasks: Acoustic scene classification, sound event detection in synthetic audio, sound event detection in real-life audio, and domestic audio tagging. We present each task in detail and analyze the submitted systems in terms of design and performance. We observe the emergence of deep learning as the most popular classification method, replacing the traditional approaches based on Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines. By contrast, feature representations have not changed substantially throughout the years, as mel frequency-based representations predominate in all tasks. The datasets created for and used in DCASE 2016 are publicly available and are a valuable resource for further research.},

The proposed method is based on extracting acoustic features that employ a relatively long temporal context, i.e., amplitude modulation filer bank (AMFB) features, prior to detection of acoustic scenes using a neural network (NN) based classification approach. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are well suited to model long-term acoustic dependencies that are known to encode important information for SC tasks. However, RNNs require a relatively large amount of training data in com-parison to feed-forward deep neural networks (DNNs). Hence, the time-delay neural network (TDNN) approach is used in the present work that enables analysis of long contextual infor-mation similar to RNNs but with training efforts comparable to conventional DNNs. The proposed SC system attains a recogni-tion accuracy of 76.5 {\%}, which is 4.0 {\%} higher compared to the DCASE'16 baseline system.},

DNN with MTL framework involves cross-task and within-task knowledge sharing layers. MTL methods have benefit for regularization effect from the cross-task knowledge sharing layers. And, within- task knowledge sharing layers allow MTL based DNN to learn information to optimize the performance for individual task. We formulate our acoustic scene classification in MTL framework using Convolutional Neural Network to learn information specific to different types of environment. We conduct experiments using DCASE2016 dataset. Proposed approach achieves 83.8{\%} accuracy to classify 15 acoustic scene classes.},

abstract = {Synthesizing and converting environmental sounds have the potential for many applications such as supporting movie and game production, data augmentation for sound event detection and scene classification. Conventional works on synthesizing and converting environmental sounds are based on a physical modeling or concatenative approach. However, there are a limited number of works that have addressed environmental sound synthesis and conversion with statistical generative models; thus, this research area is not yet well organized. In this paper, we review problem definitions, applications, and evaluation methods of environmental sound synthesis and conversion. We then report on environmental sound synthesis using sound event labels, in which we focus on the current performance of statistical environmental sound synthesis and investigate how we should conduct subjective experiments on environmental sound synthesis.},

The model is fully probabilistic and autoregressive, with the predictive distribution for each audio sample conditioned on all previous ones; nonetheless we show that it can be efficiently trained on data with tens of thousands of samples per second of audio. When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

@article{Parisi:2019:ContinualLearning:NN,
abstract = {Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire, fine-tune, and transfer knowledge and skills throughout their lifespan. This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for computational learning systems and autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without accounting for situations in which information becomes incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic forgetting. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts are required for the development of robust lifelong learning on autonomous agents and robots. We discuss well-established and emerging research motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as structural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning, intrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.},

For effective chord recognition, it is essential to utilize relevant context in audio sequence. While various machine learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been employed for the task, most of them have limitations in capturing long-term dependency or require training of an additional model. In this work, we utilize a self-attention mechanism for chord recognition to focus on certain regions of chords. Training of the proposed bi-directional Transformer for chord recognition (BTC) consists of a single phase while showing competitive performance. Through an attention map analysis, we have visualized how attention was performed. It turns out that the model was able to divide segments of chords by utilizing adaptive receptive field of the attention mechanism. Furthermore, it was observed that the model was able to effectively capture long-term dependencies, making use of essential information regardless of distance.},

However a profusion of systems has arisen to suit different tasks and datasets, utilising different feature and classifier types. This paper aims at a robust framework that can explore and utilise a range of different time-frequency features and neural networks, either singly or merged, to achieve good classification performance. In particular, we exploit three different types of front-end time-frequency feature; log energy Mel filter, Gammatone filter and constant Q transform. At the back-end we evaluate effective a two-stage model that exploits a Convolutional Neural Network for pre-trained feature extraction, followed by Deep Neural Network classifiers as a post-trained feature adaptation model and classifier. We also explore the use of a data augmentation technique for these features that effectively generates a variety of intermediate data, reinforcing model learning abilities, particularly for marginal cases. We assess performance on the DCASE2016 dataset, demonstrating good classification accuracies exceeding 90{\%}, significantly outperforming the DCASE2016 baseline and highly competitive compared to state-of-the-art systems.},

Techniques are examined in the context of Cohen's class, facilitating comparison and the design of new approaches. A trumpet example illustrates most techniques. The impact of different analysis methods on pitch and timbre examination is shown. Analyses spanning Fourier series and transform, pitch synchronous analysis, heterodyne jilter, short-time Fourier transform (STFT), phase vocoder, constant-{\&} and wavelet transforms, the Wigner distribution, and the modal distribution are all covered. The limitations of windowing methods and their reliance on steady-state assumptions and infnite duration sinusoids to define frequency and amplitude are detailed. The Wigner distribution, in contrast, uses the analytic signal to define instantaneous frequency and power parameters. The modal distribution is shown to be a linear transformation of the Wigner distribution optimized for estimating those parameters for a musical signal model. Application areas consider analysis, resynthesis, transcription, and visualization. The more stringent requirements for time-frequency (TF) distributions in these applications are compared with the weaker requirements found in speech analysis and highlight the need for further theoretical research.},

abstract = {Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) has become an integral component in applications such as smart hearing AIDS, user alert applications for physically challenged persons and robot based navigation. The Deep Learning (DL) techniques such as Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) etc. improve the accuracy and efficiency of ASC but increase computational complexity. This paper has explored the possibility of using neural network as classifiers for ASC. The observations show that an appropriately trained simple neural network can achieve similar performance as DL techniques. The developed model utilizes Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature extraction and has been verified on TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016 dataset. The developed model has attained 14.3{\%} better accuracy than existing DL models for frame based analysis.},

Further indications have been found that honeybee health can be monitored and determined through the use of acoustic analysis. In this paper, we present a system that has the ability to remotely detect the presence of pest infestation on a colony of honeybees by comparing the acoustic fingerprint of a hive to a fingerprint of known status. This will aid the goals of increasing surveillance programs by reducing the labour time and costs that are associated with managing and maintaining monitoring programs. Other benefits of the system proposed in this article include the ability to make available a collection of deterministic, standardised and nondiscriminatory statistical data for the purpose of research into determining the causes of colony collapse disorder.},

Feature representation ability directly affects the accuracy of sound classification. Therefore, the ESC performance is heavily dependent on the effectiveness of representative features extracted from the environmental sounds. In this paper, we propose a subspectrogram segmentation based ESC classification framework. In addition, we adopt the proposed Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) and score level fusion to jointly improve the classification accuracy. Extensive truncation schemes are evaluated to find the optimal number and the corresponding band ranges of sub-spectrograms. Based on the numerical experiments, the proposed framework can achieve 81.9{\%} ESC classification accuracy on the public dataset ESC-50, which provides 9.1{\%} accuracy improvement over traditional baseline schemes.},

abstract = {Repetition is a fundamental element in generating and perceiving structure in music. Recent work has applied this principle to separate the musical background from the vocal foreground in a mixture, by simply extracting the underlying repeating structure. While existing methods are effective, they depend on an assumption of periodically repeating patterns. In this work, we generalize the repetition-based source separation approach to handle cases where repetitions also happen intermittently or without a fixed period, thus allowing the processing of music pieces with fast-varying repeating structures and isolated repeating elements. Instead of looking for periodicities, the proposed method uses a similarity matrix to identify the repeating elements. It then calculates a repeating spectrogram model using the median and extracts the repeating patterns using a time-frequency masking. Evaluation on a data set of 14 full-track real-world pop songs showed that use of a similarity matrix can overall improve on the separation performance compared with a previous repetition-based source separation method, and a recent competitive music/voice separation method, while still being computationally efficient. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.},

However, such tools have always been used in a monophonic (single channel) context. A method is thus proposed to adapt the partial tracking to the case of binaural signals. This gives a tool to perform spectral analysis of such signals, keeping relevant information from both left and right channels. Moreover, azimuth (position in the horizontal plane) information for each partial is gained using interaural cues, such as interaural time differences (ITDs) and interaural level differences (ILDs). The azimuth information can then be used as an attribute or as a constraint in the binaural partial tracking algorithm. Finally, some classification results using the azimuth of partials are presented.},

However, it has thus far seen limited application to sequential data, and, as we demonstrate, existing recurrent VAE models have difficulty modeling sequences with long-term structure. To address this issue, we propose the use of a hierarchical decoder, which first outputs embeddings for subsequences of the input and then uses these embeddings to generate each subsequence independently. This structure encourages the model to utilize its latent code, thereby avoiding the "posterior collapse" problem which remains an issue for recurrent VAEs. We apply this architecture to modeling sequences of musical notes and find that it exhibits dramatically better sampling, interpolation, and reconstruction performance than a "flat" baseline model. An implementation of our "MusicVAE" is available online at http://g.co/magenta/musicvae-code.},

abstract = {The ability of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn discriminative spectro-temporal patterns makes them well suited to environmental sound classification. However, the relative scarcity of labeled data has impeded the exploitation of this family of high-capacity models. This study has two primary contributions: first, we propose a deep CNN architecture for environmental sound classification. Second, we propose the use of audio data augmentation for overcoming the problem of data scarcity and explore the influence of different augmentations on the performance of the proposed CNN architecture. Combined with data augmentation, the proposed model produces state-of-the-art results for environmental sound classification. We show that the improved performance stems from the combination of a deep, high-capacity model and an augmented training set: this combination outperforms both the proposed CNN without augmentation and a 'shallow' dictionary learning model with augmentation. Finally, we examine the influence of each augmentation on the model's classification accuracy for each class, and observe that the accuracy for each class is influenced differently by each augmentation, suggesting that the performance of the model could be improved further by applying class-conditional data augmentation.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a new mobile architecture, MobileNetV2, that improves the state of the art performance of mobile models on multiple tasks and benchmarks as well as across a spectrum of different model sizes. We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3. is based on an inverted residual structure where the shortcut connections are between the thin bottleneck layers. The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on ImageNet [1] classification, COCO object detection [2], VOC image segmentation [3]. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as actual latency, and the number of parameters.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel approach for tracking of partials in music signals based on a robust Kalman filter. Our tracker is based on a regularized least-squares approach that is designed to minimize the worst-possible regularized residual norm over the class of admissible uncertainties at each iteration. We introduce a set of state-space models for our signals based on the evolution of frequency and amplitude in different classes of musical instruments. These prior models are used to estimate future values of partial tracks in successive time frames of our spectral data. Here, the parameters of evolution models are treated as bounded uncertainties and our tracker can robustly track partials in all frequency regions. Unlike the conventional Kalman tracker, performance of this tracker is not influenced by the magnified track variations in higher frequencies. This tracker promises an improved performance over conventional Kalman tracker while preserving its good properties and superiority over existing methodologies.},

abstract = {From human language to birdsong and the chirps of insects, acoustic communication is based on amplitude and frequency modulation of sound signals. Whereas frequency processing starts at the level of the hearing organs, temporal features of the sound amplitude such as rhythms or pulse rates require processing by central auditory neurons. Besides several theoretical concepts, brain circuits that detect temporal features of a sound signal are poorly understood. We focused on acoustically communicating field crickets and show how five neurons in the brain of females form an auditory feature detector circuit for the pulse pattern of the male calling song. The processing is based on a coincidence detector mechanism that selectively responds when a direct neural response and an intrinsically delayed response to the sound pulses coincide. This circuit provides the basis for auditory mate recognition in field crickets and reveals a principal mechanism of sensory processing underlying the perception of temporal patterns.},

abstract = {We present a single-step musical tempo estimation system based solely on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Contrary to existing systems, which typically first identify onsets or beats and then derive a tempo, our system estimates the tempo directly from a conventional mel-spectrogram in a single step. This is achieved by framing tempo estimation as a multi-class classification problem using a network architecture that is inspired by conventional approaches. The system's CNN has been trained with the union of three datasets covering a large variety of genres and tempi using problem-specific data augmentation techniques. Two of the three ground-truths are novel and will be released for research purposes. As input the system requires only 11.9 s of audio and is therefore suitable for local as well as global tempo estimation. When used as a global estimator, it performs as well as or better than other state-of-the-art algorithms. Especially the exact estimation of tempo without tempo octave confusion is significantly improved. As local estimator it can be used to identify and visualize tempo drift in musical performances.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a model for the Environment Sound Classification Task (ESC) that consists of multiple feature channels given as input to a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The novelty of the paper lies in using multiple feature channels consisting of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCC), the Constant Q-transform (CQT) and Chromagram. Such multiple features have never been used before for signal or audio processing. Also, we employ a deeper CNN (DCNN) compared to previous models, consisting of 2D separable convolutions working on time and feature domain separately. The model also consists of max pooling layers that downsample time and feature domain separately. We use some data augmentation techniques to further boost performance. Our model is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on all three benchmark environment sound classification datasets, i.e. the UrbanSound8K (98.60{\%}), ESC-10 (97.25{\%}) and ESC-50 (95.50{\%}). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a single environment sound classification model is able to achieve state-of-the-art results on all three datasets and by a considerable margin over the previous models. For ESC-10 and ESC-50 datasets, the accuracy achieved by the proposed model is beyond human accuracy of 95.7{\%} and 81.3{\%} respectively.},

abstract = {We present a supervised neural network model for polyphonic piano music transcription. The architecture of the proposed model is analogous to speech recognition systems and comprises an acoustic model and a music language model. The acoustic model is a neural network used for estimating the probabilities of pitches in a frame of audio. The language model is a recurrent neural network that models the correlations between pitch combinations over time. The proposed model is general and can be used to transcribe polyphonic music without imposing any constraints on the polyphony. The acoustic and language model predictions are combined using a probabilistic graphical model. Inference over the output variables is performed using the beam search algorithm. We perform two sets of experiments. We investigate various neural network architectures for the acoustic models and also investigate the effect of combining acoustic and music language model predictions using the proposed architecture. We compare performance of the neural network-based acoustic models with two popular unsupervised acoustic models. Results show that convolutional neural network acoustic models yield the best performance across all evaluation metrics. We also observe improved performance with the application of the music language models. Finally, we present an efficient variant of beam search that improves performance and reduces run-times by an order of magnitude, making the model suitable for real-time applications.},

We propose a classification strategy by combining scores from each layer. This is based on the hypothesis that layers of the deep convolutional network learn complementary information and combining this layer-wise information provides better classification than the features extracted from an individual layer. In addition, we also propose a pooling strategy to reduce the dimensionality of features extracted from different layers of SoundNet. Our experiments on DCASE 2016 acoustic scene classification dataset reveals the effectiveness of this layer-wise ensemble approach.

@techreport{Srinivasamurthy,
abstract = {Recent approaches in meter tracking have successfully applied Bayesian models. While the proposed models can be adapted to different musical styles, the applicability of these flexible methods so far is limited because the application of exact inference is computationally demanding. More efficient approximate inference algorithms using particle filters (PF) can be developed to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we assume that the type of meter of a piece is known, and use this knowledge to simplify an existing Bayesian model with the goal of incorporating a more diverse observation model. We then propose Particle Filter based inference schemes for both the original model and the simplification. We compare the results obtained from exact and approximate inference in terms of meter tracking accuracy as well as in terms of computational demands. Evaluations are performed using corpora of Carnatic music from India and a collection of Ballroom dances. We document that the approximate methods perform similar to exact inference, at a lower computational cost. Furthermore, we show that the inference schemes remain accurate for long and full length recordings in Carnatic music.},

The filter is based upon a model for the evolution of a partial in amplitude and frequency. The parameters of this model are determined from a statistical analysis of partial behavior across a wide range of pitch from four brass instruments. Statistics are computed independently for the partial attributes of frequency and log-power first differences. We present observed power spectral density shapes, total powers, and histograms, as well as least-squares approximations to these. We demonstrate that a Kalman filter tracker using this partial model is capable of tracking partials in music. We discuss how the filter structure naturally provides quality-of-fit information about the data for use in further processing and how this information can be used to perform partial track initiation and termination within a common framework. We propose that a model-based approach to partial tracking is preferable to existing approaches which generally use heuristic rules or birth/death notions over a small time neighborhood. The advantages include better performance in the presence of cluttered data (e.g., multi-voice material) and simplified tracking over missed observations.},

Therefore, we investigate end-to-end source separation in the time-domain, which allows modelling phase information and avoids fixed spectral transformations. Due to high sampling rates for audio, employing a long temporal input context on the sample level is difficult, but required for high quality separation results because of long-range temporal correlations. In this context, we propose the Wave-U-Net, an adaptation of the U-Net to the one-dimensional time domain, which repeatedly resamples feature maps to compute and combine features at different time scales. We introduce further architectural improvements, including an output layer that enforces source additivity, an upsampling technique and a context-aware prediction framework to reduce output artifacts. Experiments for singing voice separation indicate that our architecture yields a performance comparable to a state-of-the-art spectrogram-based U-Net architecture, given the same data. Finally, we reveal a problem with outliers in the currently used SDR evaluation metrics and suggest reporting rank-based statistics to alleviate this problem.},

We report on experiments using three datasets of monotimbral recordings covering different levels of timbral complexity: isolated notes, isolated melodies, and polyphonic pieces. While data augmentation and the normalization of spectral patches turned out to be beneficial, pre-processing strategies such as logarithmic compression and channel-energy normalization did not lead to substantial improvements.

The other methods are inspired by Word2Vec, a popular technique used to learn word embeddings, and aim at reconstructing a temporal spectrogram slice from past and future slices or, alternatively, at reconstructing the context of surrounding slices from the current slice. We focus our evaluation on small encoder architectures, which can be potentially run on mobile devices during both inference (re-using a common learned representation across multiple downstream tasks) and training (capturing the true data distribution without compromising users' privacy when combined with federated learning). We evaluate the quality of the embeddings produced by the self-supervised learning models, and show that they can be re-used for a variety of downstream tasks, and for some tasks even approach the performance of fully supervised models of similar size.},

abstract = {We previously proposed a method of acoustic scene classification using a deep neural network-Gaussian mixture model (DNN-GMM) and frame-concatenated acoustic features. It was submitted to the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2016 Challenge and was ranked eighth among 49 algorithms. In the proposed method, acoustic features in temporally distant frames were concatenated to capture their temporal relationship. The experimental results indicated that the classification accuracy is improved by increasing the number of concatenated frames. On the other hand, the frame concatenation interval, which is the interval with which the frames used for frame concatenation are selected, is another important parameter. In our previous method, the frame concatenation interval was fixed to 100 ms. In this paper, we optimize the number of concatenated frames and the frame concatenation interval for the previously proposed method. As a result, it was confirmed that the classification accuracy of the method was improved by 2.61{\%} in comparison with the result submitted to the DCASE 2016.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4{\%} top-1 / 97.1{\%} top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7{\%}), Flowers (98.8{\%}), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

@article{Thakur:2019:DeepMetric:JASA,
abstract = {This paper proposes multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep metric learning for bioacoustic classification, under low training data conditions. The proposed CNN is characterized by the utilization of four different filter sizes at each level to analyze input feature maps. This multiscale nature helps in describing different bioacoustic events effectively: smaller filters help in learning the finer details of bioacoustic events, whereas, larger filters help in analyzing a larger context leading to global details. A dynamic triplet loss is employed in the proposed CNN architecture to learn a transformation from the input space to the embedding space, where classification is performed. The triplet loss helps in learning this transformation by analyzing three examples, referred to as triplets, at a time where intra-class distance is minimized while maximizing the inter-class separation by a dynamically increasing margin. The number of possible triplets increases cubically with the dataset size, making triplet loss more suitable than the softmax cross-entropy loss in low training data conditions. Experiments on three different publicly available datasets show that the proposed framework performs better than existing bioacoustic classification frameworks. Experimental results also confirm the superiority of the triplet loss over the cross-entropy loss in low training data conditions},

Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of unsupervised representation learning for ambient sound analysis using various flavors of the triplet loss. They have compared this approach to supervised learning. However, in real situations, it is common to have a small labeled dataset and a large unlabeled one. In this paper, we combine unsupervised and supervised triplet loss based learning into a semi-supervised representation learning approach. We propose two flavors of this approach, whereby the positive samples for those triplets whose anchors are unlabeled are obtained either by applying a transformation to the anchor, or by selecting the nearest sample in the training set. We compare our approach to supervised and unsupervised representation learning as well as the ratio between the amount of labeled and unlabeled data. We evaluate all the above approaches on an audio tagging task using the DCASE 2018 Task 4 dataset, and we show the impact of this ratio on the tagging performance.},

To improve robustness to loudness variation, we introduce a novel frontend called per-channel energy normalization (PCEN). The key ingredient of PCEN is the use of an automatic gain control based dynamic compression to replace the widely used static (such as log or root) compression. We evaluate PCEN on the keyword spotting task. On our large rerecorded noisy and far-field eval sets, we show that PCEN significantly improves recognition performance. Furthermore, we model PCEN as neural network layers and optimize high-dimensional PCEN parameters jointly with the keyword spotting acoustic model. The trained PCEN frontend demonstrates significant further improvements without increasing model complexity or inference-time cost.},

The framework of the model naturally quantifies these three musical concepts in terms of hidden state-variables, allowing resolution of otherwise apparent ambiguities in musical structure. At the heart of the system is a probabilistic model of a hypothetical 'bar-pointer' which maps an input signal to one cycle of a latent, periodic rhythmical pattern. The system flexibly accommodates different input signals via two observation models: a Poisson points model for use with MIDI onset data and a Gaussian process model for use with raw audio signals. The discrete state-space permits exact computation of posterior probability distributions for the quantities of interest. Results are presented for both observation models, demonstrating the ability of the system to correctly detect changes in rhythmic pattern and meter, whilst tracking tempo.},

As it stands, most tablatures are created by an experienced guitarist taking the time and effort to annotate a song. As the process is time consuming and requires expertise, we are interested in automating this task. Previous approaches to automatic tablature transcription break the problem into two steps: 1) polyphonic pitch estimation , followed by 2) tablature fingering arrangement. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we can jointly solve both steps by learning a mapping directly from audio data to tablature. The model can simultaneously leverage physical playability constraints and differences in string timbres implicit in the data to determine the actual fingerings being used by the guitarist. We propose TabCNN, a CNN for estimating guitar tablature from audio of a solo acoustic guitar performance. We train and test our network using microphone recordings from the GuitarSet dataset [24], and TabCNN outperforms a state-of-the-art multipitch estimation algorithm.

@article{Xie2019,
abstract = {Despite its success, deep learning still needs large labeled datasets to succeed. Data augmentation has shown much promise in alleviating the need for more labeled data, but it so far has mostly been applied in supervised settings and achieved limited gains. In this work, we propose to apply data augmentation to unlabeled data in a semi-supervised learning setting. Our method, named Unsupervised Data Augmentation or UDA, encourages the model predictions to be consistent between an unlabeled example and an augmented unlabeled example. Unlike previous methods that use random noise such as Gaussian noise or dropout noise, UDA has a small twist in that it makes use of harder and more realistic noise generated by state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. This small twist leads to substantial improvements on six language tasks and three vision tasks even when the labeled set is extremely small. For example, on the IMDb text classification dataset, with only 20 labeled examples, UDA outperforms the state-of-the-art model trained on 25,000 labeled examples. On standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks, CIFAR-10 with 4,000 examples and SVHN with 1,000 examples, UDA outperforms all previous approaches and reduces more than {\$}30\backslash{\%}{\$} of the error rates of state-of-the-art methods: going from 7.66{\%} to 5.27{\%} and from 3.53{\%} to 2.46{\%} respectively. UDA also works well on datasets that have a lot of labeled data. For example, on ImageNet, with 1.3M extra unlabeled data, UDA improves the top-1/top-5 accuracy from 78.28/94.36{\%} to 79.04/94.45{\%} when compared to AutoAugment.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a gated convolutional neural network and a temporal attention-based localization method for audio classification, which won the 1st place in the large-scale weakly supervised sound event detection task of Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2017 challenge. The audio clips in this task, which are extracted from YouTube videos, are manually labeled with one or a few audio tags but without timestamps of the audio events, which is called as weakly labeled data. Two sub-tasks are defined in this challenge including audio tagging and sound event detection using this weakly labeled data. A convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) with learnable gated linear units (GLUs) non-linearity applied on the log Mel spectrogram is proposed. In addition, a temporal attention method is proposed along the frames to predicate the locations of each audio event in a chunk from the weakly labeled data. We ranked the 1st and the 2nd as a team in these two sub-tasks of DCASE 2017 challenge with F value 55.6$\backslash${\%} and Equal error 0.73, respectively.},

@inproceedings{Xue:2019:DetectionLocalization:DCASE,
abstract = {Joint sound event detection (SED) and sound source localization (SSL) is essential since it provides both the temporal and spatial information of the events that appear in an acoustic scene. Although the problem can be tackled by designing a system based on the deep neural networks (DNNs) and fundamental spectral and spatial features, in this paper, we largely leverage the conventional microphone array signal processing techniques to generate more comprehensive representations for both SED and SSL, and to perform post-processing such that stable SED and SSL results can be obtained. Specifically, the features extracted from signals of multiple beams are utilized, which orient towards different directions of arrival (DOAs), and are formed according to the estimated steering vector of each DOA. Smoothed cross-power spectra (CPS) are computed based on the signal presence probability (SPP), and are used both as the input features of the DNNs, and for estimating the steering vectors of different DOAs. A triple-task learning scheme is developed, which jointly exploits the classification and regression based criterion for DOA estimation, and uses the classification based criterion as a regularization for the DNN. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields substantial improvements compared with the baseline method for the task 3 of the DCASE challenge 2019.},

@article{Ye:2018:ASC:AS,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for acoustic scene classification based on efficient acoustic feature extraction using spectro-temporal descriptors fusion. Grounded on the finding in neuroscience-"auditory system summarizes the temporal details of sounds using time-averaged statistics to understand acoustic scenes", we devise an efficient computational framework for sound scene classification by using multipe time-frequency descriptors fusion with discriminant information enhancement. To characterize rich information of sound, i.e., local structures on the time-frequency plane, we adopt 2-dimensional local descriptors. A more critical issue raised in how to logically 'summarize' those local details into a compact feature vector for scene classification. Although 'time-averaged statistics' is suggested by the psychological investigation, directly computing time average of local acoustic features is not a logical way, since arithmetic mean is vulnerable to extreme values which are anticipated to be generated by interference sounds which are irrelevant to the scene category. To tackle this problem, we develop time-frame weighting approach to enhance sound textures as well as to suppress scene-irrelevant events. Subsequently, robust acoustic feature for scene classification can be efficiently characterized. The proposed method had been validated by using Rouen dataset which consists of 19 acoustic scene categories with 3029 real samples. Extensive results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to recurrent neural network (RNN)-based beat and downbeat tracking that simultaneously performs chord recognition as an assisting task to improve performance. RNNs have been used successfully, but independently, for these two tasks. Since downbeat detection is still a challenging problem and chords are likely to change on downbeats, we propose two architectures of multi-task learning sharing the same latent representations of beats, downbeats, and chords. One is a Y-shaped architecture that decodes in parallel from the shared representations, and the other is a cascade architecture that decodes in a sequentially-dependent manner. Our comparative experiments using 85 popular songs with the time signature 4/4 from the RWC Music database showed that the F-measures of beat and down-beat detection are significantly improved on the same feature set due to the addition of simultaneous chord recognition. The Y-shaped architecture achieved the best results with a beat F-measure of 0.901 and a downbeat F-measure of 0.866, which are comparable with the current state-of-the-art.},

In this work, we propose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In essence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels. By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples. Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures. We also find that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt labels, increases the robustness to adversarial examples, and stabilizes the training of generative adversarial networks.},

@article{Zhang2020,
abstract = {Learning concepts from the limited number of datapoints is a challenging task usually addressed by the so-called one- or few-shot learning. Recently, an application of second-order pooling in few-shot learning demonstrated its superior performance due to the aggregation step handling varying image resolutions without the need of modifying CNNs to fit to specific image sizes, yet capturing highly descriptive co-occurrences. However, using a single resolution per image (even if the resolution varies across a dataset) is suboptimal as the importance of image contents varies across the coarse-to-fine levels depending on the object and its class label e. g., generic objects and scenes rely on their global appearance while fine-grained objects rely more on their localized texture patterns. Multi-scale representations are popular in image deblurring, super-resolution and image recognition but they have not been investigated in few-shot learning due to its relational nature complicating the use of standard techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale relation network based on the properties of second-order pooling to estimate image relations in few-shot setting. To optimize the model, we leverage a scale selector to re-weight scale-wise representations based on their second-order features. Furthermore, we propose to a apply self-supervised scale prediction. Specifically, we leverage an extra discriminator to predict the scale labels and the scale discrepancy between pairs of images. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on standard few-shot learning datasets.},

In training, Random Erasing randomly selects a rectangle region in an image and erases its pixels with random values. In this process, training images with various levels of occlusion are generated, which reduces the risk of over-fitting and makes the model robust to occlusion. Random Erasing is parameter learning free, easy to implement, and can be integrated with most of the CNN-based recognition models. Albeit simple, Random Erasing is complementary to commonly used data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping, and yields consistent improvement over strong baselines in image classification, object detection and person re-identification.

This paper identifies a set of features of binaural recordings suitable for the automatic classification of the four basic spatial audio scenes representing the most typical patterns of audio content distribution around a listener. Moreover, it compares the five artificial-intelligence-based methods applied to the classification of binaural recordings. The results show that both the spatial and the spectro-temporal features are essential to accurate classification of binaurally rendered acoustic scenes. The spectro-temporal features appear to have a stronger influence on the classification results than the spatial metrics. According to the obtained results, the method based on the support vector machine, exploiting the features identified in the study, yields the classification accuracy approaching 84{\%}.},
