% - Bibitems sorted by year and within year alphatetically by author
% - Use similar conventions as DBLP-conventions
% - Write out first names of all authors:
%   firstname1 lastname1 and firstname2 lastname2 and ...
% - For label use the following convention
%   * Full last name for first author,
%   * first last name letters of all other authors
%   * year_keyword_conference ...
%   Example: BaakMS08_KeyframeMotion_ACM-MIR
% - user "comment"-field for keywords (internal usage)
% - pages = {451--458}, i.e. with double dash
% - use {...} for the fields, not "..."
%
%
%    No year or ordering numbers in booktitle
%    =========================================
%    {Proceedings of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference ({ISMIR})} instead
%    of {Proceedings of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference ({ISMIR} 2007)}
%
%    No place information in booktitle
%    =========================================
%    {Proceedings of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference ({ISMIR})} instead
%    of {Proceedings of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference ({ISMIR}), London, UK}
%
%    Do not abbreviate 'Proceedings '
%    =========================================
%    {Proceedings of the ...} anstatt {Proc. ...}
%
%    Addresses
%    =========================================
%    The 'inproceedings' evironment specifies a field "address" (not "location"!). If possible,
%    this field should be set with city and country. Example: {New York, USA}.
%
%    Month
%    =========================================
%    The month is not specified
%
%    Usage of capital letters
%    =========================================
%    The title should be written in sentence case, i.e. everything except for the first word uses small letters.
%    Title case, i.e. capital letters for the words first letter and then small letters, is also acceptable.
%    The final choice is left to the bibtex style.
%    Exception: known abbreviations like MIDI and German Papers. Examples:
%    {Synchronization of music data in score-, {MIDI}- and {PCM}-format}: correct
%    {Synchronization of Music Data in Score-, {MIDI}- and {PCM}-format}: correct
%    {{Synchronization of music data in score-, MIDI- and PCM-format}}  : incorrect
%    {Synchronization of music data in score-, MIDI- and PCM-format}    : incorrect
%    {SYNCHRONIZATION OF MUSIC DATA IN SCORE-, {MIDI}- AND {PCM}-FORMAT}: incorrect
%    {Musicmatching bei {V}ariabilit{\"a}ten in der {H}armonik und {P}olyphonie} : correct
%
%    Conference name
%    =========================================
%    Write: Proceedings of the... and place the abbreviation behind the full name in brackets.
%    Example: {Proceedings of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference ({ISMIR})}
%
%    Further fields
%    =========================================
%    Some bibtex entries contain additional fields not in our standard. Delete those fields.
%
%    (accepted for publication)
%    =========================================
%    Place (accepted for publication) in the journal or booktitle field. Otherwise, depending on the bibtex
%    style, 'pp.' or 'vol.' are appended.
