abstract = {In this article, we present an account of the state of the art in acoustic scene classification (ASC), the task of classifying environments from the sounds they produce. Starting from a historical review of previous research in this area, we define a general framework for ASC and present different implementations of its components. We then describe a range of different algorithms submitted for a data challenge that was held to provide a general and fair benchmark for ASC techniques. The data set recorded for this purpose is presented along with the performance metrics that are used to evaluate the algorithms and statistical significance tests to compare the submitted methods.},

abstract = {Recently, neural network-based deep learning methods have been popularly applied to computer vision, speech signal processing and other pattern recognition areas. Remarkable success has been demonstrated by using the deep learning approaches. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive survey for the neural network-based deep learning approaches on acoustic event detection. Different deep learning-based acoustic event detection approaches are investigated with an emphasis on both strongly labeled and weakly labeled acoustic event detection systems. This paper also discusses how deep learning methods benefit the acoustic event detection task and the potential issues that need to be addressed for prospective real-world scenarios.},
